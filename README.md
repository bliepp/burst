# BURST - bliepp's universal rockylinux setup tool
A setup script sepcifically tailored towards my personal needs.

## Usage
Make sure to execute as root
```bash
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bliepp/burst/main/install.sh | bash
```

## What it does
As I frequently use apache's httpd behind a nginx reverse proxy on rocky linux this provides a default setup to make life easier.
It also isntalls commonly used tools like wget, python and php.
